# node-sqlite3 with CentOS 7 support

Mainly used for my another project - [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma)

## What is the different between TryGhost/node-sqlite3?

The official one is dropped the support for CentOS 7, but my fork supports CentOS 7. 

If you want to build a Node.js application which can be installed on many Linux distributions like Uptime Kuma, this library should be useful.

If your application will be just designed for new Linux distributions, you probably do not need it, just use the official one.


PS: No electron supports

## How to use

```
npm install @louislam/sqlite3
npm remove sqlite3
```

Replace require("@louislam/sqlite") in your source code
